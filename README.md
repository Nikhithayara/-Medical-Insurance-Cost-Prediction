🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on individual attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of dependents using Machine Learning techniques.

The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate insurance charges accurately and help insurance companies make data-driven pricing decisions.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following features:

age – Age of the policyholder

sex – Gender (male/female)

bmi – Body Mass Index

children – Number of dependents

smoker – Smoking status (yes/no)

region – Residential region

charges – Medical insurance cost (Target Variable)
